Warning
===

This is *very* fresh code that is still in development. Of course, comments,
suggestions, ideas, critisisms, random facts about anything whatsoever or jokes
are always welcome.

It's extremely new, please don't judge me on this code just now(!) (although
it's not too bad, I'm not happy with inconsistencies in the way instances of
the different classes are instantiated). If you're in the mood for judging code
quality, you may be better off looking at something more complete, like:

http://github.com/Spakman/jobby/blob/master/lib/server.rb

(or not - seeing a development process is as important as more complete code,
in my opinion)


BBC audio on demand
===

This library is a small set of classes to make accessing and traversing the BBC
audio on demand (iPlayer for radio, basically) XML feeds easier. The feeds
cover around seven days of scheduling which the BBC update every three or so
hours (I think).

Also, BBCAudioOnDemand::LiveStreaming contains all of the URIs for the live ASX
XML files that the BBC produce.


Me
===

It's only me on this project just now. All are welcome (unless I don't think
you're code's good enough - if you disagree, fork away!).
